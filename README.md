# Release tooling

Release tooling for Redwood. See the [package.json](./package.json) scripts for the available commands.

## Notes

- This project uses Yarn's [Zero-installs](https://yarnpkg.com/features/caching#zero-installs)
- The code for release is incomplete. Use the release script in the RedwoodJS monorepo for the time being.
